        If you've tried diet after diet only to end up back where you started (or heavier), please know this: it's not your fault. The diet industry has failed you, not the other way around. Let's explore why traditional diets don't work and what actually does.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Hard Truth About Diets</h2>
      <p>
        Research shows that 95% of diets fail within 2-5 years. That's not because people lack willpower—it's because diets fundamentally misunderstand how our bodies and minds work. Your body is designed to survive, and it interprets dieting as a threat to that survival.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Psychological Reasons Diets Fail</h2>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">1. Restriction Leads to Rebellion</h3>
      <p>
        When you tell yourself you "can't" have something, your brain immediately wants it more. This is called psychological reactance—our natural resistance to having our freedom limited. The more restrictive the diet, the stronger the eventual backlash.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-pink-50 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Think about it:</p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Have you ever been "good" on your diet all day, only to binge on forbidden foods at night? That's not a lack of willpower—that's your brain rebelling against artificial restrictions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">2. All-or-Nothing Thinking</h3>
      <p>
        Diets promote black-and-white thinking: foods are "good" or "bad," you're "on" or "off" the diet. This perfectionist mindset sets you up for failure because life isn't perfect. One "slip-up" becomes an excuse to abandon all progress.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">3. External Rules Override Internal Wisdom</h3>
      <p>
        Diets teach you to ignore your body's natural hunger and fullness cues in favor of external rules. Over time, you lose touch with your body's innate ability to regulate food intake—a skill you were born with.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">4. Shame and Guilt Cycle</h3>
      <p>
        When diets inevitably fail, we blame ourselves. This shame leads to emotional eating, which leads to more dieting, creating a vicious cycle that damages both our relationship with food and our self-esteem.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Physiological Reasons Diets Backfire</h2>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">1. Metabolic Adaptation</h3>
      <p>
        When you drastically reduce calories, your metabolism slows down to conserve energy. This is your body's survival mechanism. Even after you stop dieting, your metabolism may remain slower, making weight regain almost inevitable.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">2. Hormonal Changes</h3>
      <p>
        Dieting disrupts hormones that regulate hunger and satiety. Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) increases, while leptin (the fullness hormone) decreases. These changes can persist for months or even years after dieting ends.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">3. Increased Food Preoccupation</h3>
      <p>
        Studies show that food restriction increases mental preoccupation with food. The famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment demonstrated that even healthy men became obsessed with food when their calories were restricted.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">What Actually Works: A Different Approach</h2>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">1. Intuitive Eating</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of external diet rules, learn to trust your body's internal cues. Eat when hungry, stop when satisfied, and honor your cravings without judgment. This approach has been shown to improve both physical and mental health.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">2. Gentle Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        Focus on adding nourishing foods rather than restricting "bad" ones. When you approach nutrition from a place of self-care rather than punishment, healthy choices become easier and more sustainable.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">Gentle nutrition principles:</p>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>• All foods can fit into a healthy diet</li>
          <li>• Focus on how foods make you feel</li>
          <li>• Eat for energy and satisfaction</li>
          <li>• Include foods you enjoy</li>
          <li>• Listen to your body's needs</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">3. Address Emotional Eating</h3>
      <p>
        Many people eat for reasons other than hunger. Learning to identify and address emotional triggers is crucial for lasting change. This might involve developing new coping skills or working through underlying issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">4. Focus on Behaviors, Not Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of focusing solely on weight loss, concentrate on developing healthy behaviors: regular meals, adequate sleep, stress management, and joyful movement. Weight often stabilizes naturally when these behaviors are in place.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">Healing Your Relationship with Food</h2>

      <p>
        True food freedom comes from healing your relationship with food, not from finding the "perfect" diet. This process involves:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-3 text-gray-700 my-6">
        <li>• <strong>Self-compassion:</strong> Treating yourself with kindness, especially during setbacks</li>
        <li>• <strong>Body trust:</strong> Learning to trust your body's wisdom about food and hunger</li>
        <li>• <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Developing a flexible approach to eating that works with your life</li>
        <li>• <strong>Patience:</strong> Understanding that lasting change takes time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">Your Next Steps</h2>

      <p>
        If you're ready to break free from the diet cycle, start small. Begin by noticing your hunger and fullness cues. Practice eating without distractions. Be curious about your food choices rather than judgmental.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-pink-100 p-8 rounded-xl mt-12">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Remember:</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You are not broken, and you don't need to be fixed. You need to unlearn diet culture's harmful messages and reconnect with your body's natural wisdom. This journey takes courage, but you're worth it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-8">
        The path to food freedom isn't about finding the perfect diet—it's about finding peace with food and with yourself. And that peace is absolutely possible for you.
      </p>
